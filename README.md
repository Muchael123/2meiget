## What is Tumeiget? 
2meiget is an online platform that allows students to search for their lost ids. As the ids are found, they are taken to a cental point and id numbers uploaded to the database where  owners can search for them. There are arrangements to improve the systems coverage to cover th society e.g other institutions and companies apart from educational ones.
once the lost id is found, It is taken to a central place within the instution and if users has the details recorded, they recieve an email and sms.
Currently, only the web version is available. There is a plan to improve the admin section via a easy to use mobile app that scans the ids and, using ocr, records the information to the database automatically.

## what problems does tumeiget?
Tumeiget seems to address several common problems related to lost IDs:

1. **Inconvenience for Students**: Losing an ID can be a significant inconvenience for students, as it may restrict their access to campus facilities, events, or services. Tumeiget provides a centralized platform for students to search for and retrieve their lost IDs, reducing the hassle of dealing with multiple offices or departments to locate them.

2. **Administrative Burden**: Handling lost IDs can be a time-consuming task for administrative staff at educational institutions. Tumeiget streamlines this process by providing a centralized database where found IDs can be logged and matched with their owners. This reduces the administrative burden and allows staff to focus on other tasks.

3. **Communication Challenges**: Without a centralized system, notifying students about their lost IDs can be challenging. Tumeiget addresses this by incorporating email and SMS notifications, ensuring that owners are promptly informed when their IDs are found.

4. **Limited Coverage**: Initially focusing on educational institutions, Tumeiget aims to expand its coverage to include other organizations and companies. This expansion will address the problem of lost IDs in various sectors beyond academia, providing a broader service to the community.

5. **Manual Data Entry**: Recording information from found IDs into a database manually can be prone to errors and time-consuming. The planned mobile app with OCR functionality will automate this process, improving accuracy and efficiency.
