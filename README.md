# 2Meiget
2meiget is an online platform that allows students to search for their lost ids. As the ids are found, they are taken to a cental point and id numbers uploaded to the database where  owners can search for them. There are arrangements to improve the systems coverage to cover th society e.g other institutions and companies apart from educational ones.
once the lost id is found, It is taken to a central place within the instution and if users has the details recorded, they recieve an email and sms.
Currently, only the web version is available. There is a plan to improve the admin section via a easy to use mobile app that scans the ids and, using ocr, records the information to the database automatically.
